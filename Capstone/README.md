Here's the review for this project proposal.

This project is based on data gathered from Meetup's official API. Make sure to place the pickle file "Miami_meetup_members_save.p" in the same folder as the notebook before running it.
It is included in the .zip archive but as an alternative you can download it here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4e8hPiOu5QHT2IyQktyTFdlSTQ/view?usp=sharing

This project uses Python 2.7 and the following libraries:
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- scipy
- pandas
- pprint
- gensim
- matplotlib

As a heads up, some parts take quite a lot of computational resources. I personally used a laptop, with a i7-6500U 2.5GHz and 8G of RAM.
